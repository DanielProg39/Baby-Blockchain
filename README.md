# Baby Blockchain
A very simple payment blockchain implementation (without decentralization and consensus, only basic mechanics)

------------

The "Baby blockchain" is a minimal version of the blockchain designed for payments. It aims to provide a simplified and streamlined platform for secure and efficient transactions.

### Content
The system will likely include a database to store transactions and user information, as well as a user interface for accessing and managing the transactions. Other potential components could include cryptographic algorithms for securing the transactions, a payment gateway for processing payments, and a system for managing user accounts.

### Interaction
This blockchain could potentially integrate with other financial systems, such as banking systems or payment processors, to facilitate seamless transactions and ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure. Additionally, it could interface with existing blockchain systems for added security and functionality.

### Features

- Secure transactions: The use of cryptographic algorithms will help to ensure the security of transactions and protect against fraud and hacking.
- User-friendly interface: A simple and intuitive interface will make it easy for users to manage their transactions and track their payments.
- Payment processing: The system will be capable of processing and tracking payments, making it a convenient and efficient solution for making transactions.
- Compatibility: This blockchain may be designed to be compatible with existing financial systems, making it a flexible and practical solution for users.

### Security requirements

- Confidentiality: Personal and financial information of users should be protected and kept confidential.
- Integrity: Transactions should be tamper-proof and the system should be able to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to transactions.
- Availability: The system should be available and accessible to users at all times, with appropriate measures in place to ensure its reliability and stability.

### Users
The end users of the blockchain could be individuals, businesses, or financial institutions looking for a secure and efficient solution for making payments.

### Restrictions

- Decentralization and consensus: Since this is a minimal version of the blockchain, it will not include decentralization and consensus mechanisms.
- Scalability: Depending on the design and implementation, the system may not be able to handle high volumes of transactions and may need to be scaled in the future.
