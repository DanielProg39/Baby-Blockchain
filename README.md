# Baby Blockchain
A very simple payment blockchain implementation (without decentralization and consensus, only basic mechanics)

------------

### Overview

A "Baby blockchain" is a simplified version of a blockchain that focuses on the core elements of a blockchain system, such as recording transactions and maintaining a ledger. Unlike a full-fledged blockchain, it does not require a decentralized network of nodes or consensus mechanisms.

### Content

- A database to store the transactions and user information
- A system for accessing and managing the transactions
- Cryptographic algorithms for securing the transactions and protecting against fraud
- A payment gateway for processing payments
- A system for managing user accounts

### Product features

- Secure transactions through the use of cryptographic algorithms
- An interface for easy management of transactions
- Payment processing capabilities for efficient and convenient transactions

### Security requirements

- Confidentiality of personal and financial information
- Tamper-proof transactions with integrity maintained
- High availability to ensure the system is accessible and reliable at all times

### Users

Individuals, businesses, or financial institutions looking for a secure and efficient solution for making payments.

### Restrictions

- Lack of decentralization and consensus mechanisms compared to a full-fledged blockchain
- Limited scalability, which may require future scaling efforts to handle high volumes of transactions.
